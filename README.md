# DOX Extras
Adds extra features and dinos to the DinoOverhaul X (DOX) mod. All craftable items are crafted in the [DOX Extras Workbench](https://github.com/Daniel0Widing/DOXExtras#dox-extras-workbench). All recipes are automatically available in the DOX Extras Workbench to prevent engram spam.

## Installing the Mod
Log into Steam, go to [DOX Extras](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2927749831), and subscribe to the mod. While you're at it, you should also subscribe to [DinoOverhaul X](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=710880648) since it doesn't make sense to use this mod without it. Then launch ARK and the mods should automatically download. When you create your world/server, place this mod directly after DOX in the mod load order for best results.

## GameUserSettings.ini Configuration
Add the following section to the bottom of your GameUserSettings.ini file and change the settings you want changed. The names should all be self-explanatory.

```
[DOXExtras]
CanSacrificeClones=False
```

## Tiers
In DOX, dino tiers go from Normal\*, to Apex, to Prime, to Unique/Ancient, to Primal, with some special cases sprinkled in.

For DOX Extras, dino tiers are entirely linear. This means each tier is better than the previous tier and worse than the next tier. The tiers, in order, are:

**Prime -> Rare -> Ancient -> Primal**

These tiers line up with the standard DOX tiers, with Rare falling in-between Prime and Ancient, and Unique being left out.

Each tier has its own saddle and dinosaur spawner item, along with a corresponding color scheme which is applied to all matching dinosaurs, saddles, and spawners of each tier. The colors are:

| Tier | Color |
| --- | --- |
| Prime | Lime |
| Rare | Yellow |
| Ancient | Magenta & Yellow |
| Primal | DarkLavender & Glacial |

_If the color names look strange, that's because they are the color code names used in ARK's code_

## Damage
Damage in ARK generally works by multiplying incoming damage by all resistance modifiers.
```
Recieved Damage = Incoming Damage * Resistance Modifiers
```
where
```
Resistance Modifiers = Armor multiplier * Bone multiplier * Buff multiplier(s) * Inate multiplier(s)
```
These resistance modifiers in more detail are:
| Type | Explaination | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Armor | Resistance that scales with the equipped armor rating | Saddles, equipped armor |
| Bone | Resistance based on where the damage impact was | Turtle shell, Trike head |
| Buff | Resistance that is active as long as the buff is | Yuty Courage buff, Imprinting buff |
| Inate | Resistance to certain damage types built into some dinos | Many dinos take reduced damage from ranged attacks |

How resistance modifiers affect damage is based on the damage type of the damage. The following are the _general_ categories damage types fall into:
| Type | Affected by | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Normal | Armor, all modifiers | Dilo bite, Rex bite, Firearms |
| Piercing | all/most modifiers | Manta attacks, Theri slashes, Turrets |
| Passive | Inate modifiers | Wyverns/Basalisk poison |
| True | Nothing | Hellbound Hog bites, (does not exist in vanilla ARK) |

On top of this, damage can also be adjusted after all modifiers are taken into account but before it is applied. This adjustment is generally pretty rare, but is very dynamic. Some adjustments involve limiting maximum damage taken (tiered Andrewsarchus), or adding additional damage-type agnostic multipliers (Stego Hardened Plate mode). As this adjustment takes place after resistance calculations, it is capable of reducing true damage.

_Disclaimer: This is my current understanding of how damage works in ARK from going through the source files and working on this mod. If you see something incorrect with this understanding, please let me know._

## Added Dinos:
### Andrewsarchus
<details><summary>------- Info ---------</summary>
	
The upgraded Andrewsarchus focuses on **Health** and **Support**. Its damage output is lack luster compared to similar level tames, so it's best used to soak up damage while other dinos dish out damage. Many of its attacks, especially at higher tiers, inflict debuffs on enemies hit, and all tiers provide AOE healing to nearby friendlies. It also has a scaling damage cap which makes it excellent for tanking very powerful attacks without getting 1-shot.
	
All saddles for upgraded Andrewsarchuses use [Advanced Element Bullets](https://github.com/Daniel0Widing/DOXExtras#advanced-element-bullets).

- Stamina becomes infinite.

After the buff runs out, the Andrewsarchus cannot activate the buff again until it recovers (15 min).
```
	
\+ **Hellbound Hog** Ability:
```
When the Andrewsarchus reaches death's door, it takes its final stand before crossing the threshold:
- All active buffs are cleared and no new buffs can be applied.
- Stamina becomes infinite.
- Speed (+37.5%) greatly increases.
- Melee damage (+500%) massively increases
- Main attack deals true damage within a massive range (+300%) and a powerful DOT
- Becomes immune to all damage.
- Cannot be cryopoded during this state.
After this state runs out (60 sec), the Andrewsarchus's body turns to fire and plumets into hell, leaving behind a gravestone with its items where it hits the ground. (ÔΩÄ–¥¬¥)„Çù ü´°
